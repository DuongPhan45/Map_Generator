# Map_Generator
A rudimentary mapping program in Java. The program could :
- Plot a map given a data set representing the roads and intersections in a specific geographic region
- Provide shortest path directions between any two arbitrary intersections chosen by the user using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Generate the minimum weight spanning tree for the entire map
